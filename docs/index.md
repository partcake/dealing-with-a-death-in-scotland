# Welcome

This website details some of the technical administrative aspects of dealing 
with a death in Scotland. Much of what is written applies equally to the rest 
of the UK. The website is written to augment the useful but limited 
guidance provided by the [UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies) 
and 
[Scottish Government](https://www.gov.scot/collections/what-to-do-after-a-death-in-scotland/).

The information presented on this website is not guidance, nor advice, and is 
provided without warranty.

## Emotional support

I do not go into the emotional aspects of dealing with a death other than to 
write that I (and others) have found some therapeutic value in administrating 
the estate of a deceased relative.

throughout the UK. For additional resources please visit the bereavement

## In Memoriam

This website is dedicated to my eldest brother, Nick, who was an exceptionally
bright and original character. He was self-taught and self-made. Nick died by 
suicide in 2022. He is dearly missed.
