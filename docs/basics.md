# Getting Started

## Single point of contact

If there is a Will, the named Executors should arrange to divide the 
institutions that will need to be contacted between them. Each Executor 
should notify the institutions assigned to them of the death and take 
responsibility for communicating with those institutions henceforth.

> **_WHY?_** Financial institutions have wildly varying policies 
around who they will communicate with regarding the deceased's account(s). Some 
are very restrictive and it can be difficult to change. Hence it is easiest if 
*one* Executor takes responsibility for communicating with an institution from 
the outset.

## Documents required

Depending on the number of financial institutions the deceased engaged, you may 
need an equal number of death certificates (originals or certified copies) and 
certified copies of name and address identification for all of the named 
Executors. Most institutions will accept certification by any of 
[the usual registered professional persons](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document)
however, some institutions will only accept copies of documents certified by a 
solicitor.
