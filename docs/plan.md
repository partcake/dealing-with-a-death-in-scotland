# The Plan

The [UK Government step-by-step guide](https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies) is 
excellent but it will be necessary to consult the 
[Scottish Government guidance](https://www.gov.scot/collections/what-to-do-after-a-death-in-scotland/) 
for particulars specific to Scotland.

Broadly:

1.    [Register the death](https://www.mygov.scot/register-death) (a [medical certificate](https://www.gov.scot/publications/death-scotland-practical-advice-times-bereavement-revised-11th-edition-2016-9781786522726/pages/4/) may be required)
2.    [Tell government about the death](https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once) (Tell Us Once service)
3.    Try to [find the latest Will and any codicils (amendments)](https://www.gov.scot/publications/death-scotland-practical-advice-times-bereavement-revised-11th-edition-2016-9781786522726/pages/11/)
4.    [Arrange the funeral](https://www.mygov.scot/browse/births-deaths-marriages/death-bereavement/funerals-burials-cremations)
5.    Evaluate your [personal circumstances (benefits / right to reside)](https://www.mygov.scot/browse/births-deaths-marriages/death-bereavement/money-housing-death)
6.    Make an [inventory](inventory.md) and [value the estate](value.md)
7.    Deal with the deceased's [Companies and Partnerships](companies.md)
8.    Calculate and pay [Inheritance Tax](iht.md)
8.    Apply for [Confirmation](confirmation.md) (probate elsewhere in the UK)
9.    Deal with the estate
